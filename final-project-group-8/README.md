# Description
We used VelNet to have two users play eachother at a giant version of Chess. Oculus Integration is used to interact with the world. ReadyPlayerMe was used for the avatars and NPCs.

# Issues
Getting each user to be able to see the other person's Avatar was a struggle. We also found difficutlies in granting access to move objects for the 2nd player.
