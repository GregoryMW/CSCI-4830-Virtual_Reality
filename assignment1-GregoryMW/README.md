# Description
The Unity project begins with a blue floor object with two manually created objects. One is a snowman I made by using the primitive objects available in Unity to represent the player, and the other is a 3D pyramid that has its mesh created on runtime by a script. Both objects rotate along the y axis at a uniform speed of 10 units, and there are two cameras that share display 1 split down the middle, with each camera showing individually one of the two objects rotating.

# Issues
The only issue I ran into was that the pyramid is rotating along the first vector point at (0,0,0), and not its center. I was unable to figure out how to change the center of rotation without using functions that had not been learned in class.
