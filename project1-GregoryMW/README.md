# Description

This project involves creating a short game within a VR space. Within this project is a game in which the player must navigate through a dark maze while (optionally) hold a flashlight. The player must press each numbered button in ascending order throughout the maze (upon which a sound is played to let the player know they were correct), and return to the start  and push the "finished" button once all three buttons have been activated. The scene then reloads and the player is sent back to the beginning of the game.

# Issues

My main issue with this project was finding an efficient way to track which buttons have bene pressed and if they have pressed in the right order. I eventually solved this be creating a text-pro object and used a numbered text to compare it with the text of the buttons to see which should be activated next.
