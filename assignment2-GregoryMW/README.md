# Description

This assignment consists of a Rube Goldberg machine that has 4 distinct phases of movement. The first phase involves a hammer with a hinge joint hitting a steel ball to begin the machine. The next phase involves two see-saws that the ball rolls onto and tilts accordingly. The third phase involves a cube that, when the ball makes contact with the see-saw, drops onto the opposite side of the see-saw and flings the ball across the screen. The last phase contains a basket-like object that carries the ball by script to a Plinko machine and drops the ball into the machine.

# Issues

I had an issue involving detecting contact between two objects, but was solved by making sure both objects containted a RigidBody before calling the script.
